Zork is a very * simple, text based adventure game. Users can walk around some scenery. That's * all. It should really be extended to make it more interesting! *  * To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play" * routine. *  * This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all rooms, * creates the parser and starts the game. It also evaluates the commands that * the parser returns.. */class Game {	/* created booleans for later*/	boolean done8 = false; //booleans for the locked puzzle rooms	boolean done10 = false;	boolean done19 = false;	boolean doneCC = false; 	boolean blood = false;	boolean eggs = false;	boolean milk = false;	boolean chocolate = false;	boolean portalgun = false;		//called audio modules	private Audio audioModule;	private Puzzle puzzle; //calls puzzle class	private Parser parser; //calls parser class	private Room currentRoom;	// This is a MASTER object that contains all of the rooms and is easily accessible.	// The key will be the name of the room -> no spaces (Use all caps and underscore -> Great Room would have a key of GREAT_ROOM	// In a hashmap keys are case sensitive.	// masterRoomMap.get("GREAT_ROOM") will return the Room Object that is the Great Room (assuming you have one).	private HashMap<String, Room> masterRoomMap;	private ArrayList<String> inventory = new ArrayList<String>(); //array list of holding inventory	private void initRooms(String fileName) throws Exception {		masterRoomMap = new HashMap<String, Room>();//reading the files		Scanner roomScanner;		try {			HashMap<String, HashMap<String, String>> exits = new HashMap<String, HashMap<String, String>>();			roomScanner = new Scanner(new File(fileName));			while (roomScanner.hasNext()) {				Room room = new Room();				// Read the Name				String roomName = roomScanner.nextLine();				room.setRoomName(roomName.split(":")[1].trim());				// Read the Description				String roomDescription = roomScanner.nextLine();				room.setDescription(roomDescription.split(":")[1].replaceAll("<br>", "\n").trim());				// Read the Exits				String roomExits = roomScanner.nextLine();				String itemsScan = roomScanner.nextLine();				ArrayList<String> roomItems = new ArrayList<String>();				if (!itemsScan.equals("Items: None")) {					String[] itemArray = itemsScan.split(":")[1].split(",");					for (String i : itemArray) {						roomItems.add(i);					}					room.setItems(roomItems);				}								// An array of strings in the format E-RoomName				String[] rooms = roomExits.split(":")[1].split(",");				HashMap<String, String> temp = new HashMap<String, String>();				for (String s : rooms) {					temp.put(s.split("-")[0].trim(), s.split("-")[1]);				}				exits.put(roomName.substring(10).trim().toUpperCase().replaceAll(" ", "_"), temp);				// This puts the room we created (Without the exits in the masterMap)				masterRoomMap.put(roomName.toUpperCase().substring(10).trim().replaceAll(" ", "_"), room);				// Now we better set the exits.			}			for (String key : masterRoomMap.keySet()) {				Room roomTemp = masterRoomMap.get(key);				HashMap<String, String> tempExits = exits.get(key);				for (String s : tempExits.keySet()) {					// s = direction					// value is the room.					String roomName2 = tempExits.get(s.trim());					Room exitRoom = masterRoomMap.get(roomName2.toUpperCase().replaceAll(" ", "_"));					roomTemp.setExit(s.trim().charAt(0), exitRoom);				}			}			roomScanner.close();		} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {			e.printStackTrace();		}	}	/**	 * Create the game and initialise its internal map.	 */	public Game() {		try {			audioModule = new Audio();			initRooms("data/rooms.dat");			currentRoom = masterRoomMap.get("TRAINING_CENTER");		} catch (Exception e) {			// TODO Auto-generated catch block			e.printStackTrace();		}		parser = new Parser();	}	/**	 * Main play routine.
